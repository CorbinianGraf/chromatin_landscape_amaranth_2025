# code/assemble_isoseq/

Assemble Iso-Seq data from different sources and combine with the computational gene prediction:
- gmst2globalCoords.py = slightly adjusted helper script.
- mapping_and_collapse_v2.sh = Assembly of public Iso-Seq data already used for genome annotation v2.
- mapping_and_collapse_v3.sh = Assembly of newly generated Iso-Seq data.
- analyse_isoseq.Rmd = Analyse and merge both datasets. Integrate into the genome annotation.
